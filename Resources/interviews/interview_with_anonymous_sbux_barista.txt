INTERVIEW WITH A STARBUCKS BARISTA
most popular coffee drinks: white mocha, caramel macchiato, iced coffee, cold brew, anything with vanilla sweet cream foam

growing in popularity: "tiktok drinks", which are good for the bottom line because these drinks tend to be "inclusion-heavy", which means lots of up-charges. However, these drinks are more complicated to make and require a larger time investment because the barista has to really pay attention to the custom recipe

non-coffee drinks: peach green tea lemonade, guava passionfruit drink, matcha green tea latte, non-coffee frappachinos. in winter, hot chocolate and caramel apple spice.

in-between: refreshers are very popular, but many people aren't aware they are coffee-based and contain caffiene. the guava passionfruit tea is a non-coffee, non-caffiene alternative to the very popular "pink drink", which contains coffee and caffiene.

ready to drink and eat (rtdne) - water bottles, eggs and cheese protein boxes, cheese and fruit protein boxes, tomato mozarella panini (more popular than meat version), horizon boxed chocolate milk 

note: sbux donates a portion of all their ethos water bottles to charity

pastry case (sandwiches) - bacon gouda sandwiches, anything with bacon on it - breakfast sandwiches are popular in general

pastry case (sweets) - cheese danish, birthday cake pops, banana walnut bread

note: cake pops have a wide profit margin and are WILDLY popular, birthday is #1 seller

size offerings are important! sbux offers massive drinks with free refills that taste better than dunkin' or mcdonalds. 

independent shops should invest in:
- simple latte art (sbux social media = take pic of the side/sticker, not the top of the drink)
- general aesthetics (colored/layered drinks are very popular)
- have non-coffee, non-coffee-flavored drinks that are "instagrammable"
- boba - due to the back rooms at sbux being very small, they have to be very mindful of the amount of space that any new menu item will take up. this means that right now they can't add boba to their menu, even though boba is wildly popular and their customers are actively trying to figure out how to create customer starbucks drinks that taste like milk tea/boba.
- comfy seating - starbucks seems to be moving away from comfy couches and chairs to easier-to-clean surfaces, and customers are complaining
- friendly/familiar staff - customers complain that the staff change too frequently at starbucks and they will choose places where they feel like they know the staff
- atmosphere in general - people will often switch coffee shops for atmosphere over quality
- speed - sbux can churn orders out very quickly and most indie shops can't compete.
